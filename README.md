LIT-Canvas-Files
================

LIT is Western Libraries' research tutorial. These files are the Canvas LMS course files. Each course file includes modules that link to the lessons (on the LIT website) and quizzes.


This repository contains three versions of Canvas courses. One file is LIT, all six lessons and six quizzes. One file is Academic Integrity, which is the last LIT lesson and includes one lesson and one quiz. The third file contains both LIT and Academic Integrity, as modules.
